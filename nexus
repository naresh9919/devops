                                            SONATYPE NEXUS

Sonatype Nexus System Requirements


Minimum 1 VCPU & 2 GB Memory
Server firewall opened for port 22 & 8081
OpenJDK 8
All Nexus processes should run as a non-root nexus user.

Step 1: Login to your Linux server and update the yum packages. Also install required utilities.

# sudo yum update -y
# sudo yum install wget -y

Step 2: Install OpenJDK 1.8

# sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk.x86_64 -y
# cd /opt/
# sudo wget -O nexus.tar.gz https://download.sonatype.com/nexus/3/latest-unix.tar.gz
# tar -xvf nexus.tar.gz
# sudo mv nexus-3* nexus


Step 5: As a good security practice, it is not advised to run nexus service with root privileges. So create a new user named nexus to run the nexus service.

# sudo adduser nexus
# sudo chown -R nexus:nexus /opt/nexus
# sudo chown -R nexus:nexus /opt/sonatype-work

Step 6: Open /opt/nexus/bin/nexus.rc file

# sudo vi  /opt/nexus/bin/nexus.rc

     run_as_user="nexus"

# sudo chkconfig nexus on

# sudo systemctl start nexus

visit http://public IP:8081. You will be able to see the nexus homepage

Default username is admin

admin password in /opt/sonatype-work/nexus3/admin.password

# cat /opt/sonatype-work/nexus3/admin.password

# sudo systemctl restart nexus

# install pluggin - nexus artifact uploader
